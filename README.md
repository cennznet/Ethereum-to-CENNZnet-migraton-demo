# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

To run this project

We'll use Alchemy to access a node, create a free account and get some test tokens to use on Rinkeby using the [Alchemy faucet](https://www.rinkebyfaucet.com/).

* Create an ethereum account and get tokens to use on Rinkeby
* Get your account private key using MetaMask following [this guide](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key)

Compile and deploy using Remix



## Notes from the original project

This project is from this Ethereum game tutorial
https://betterprogramming.pub/create-a-blockchain-game-with-solidity-web3-and-vue-js-c75eed4b49a6


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
